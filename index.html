        <div class="con">
            <p>Zorbing (also known as globe-riding, sphereing, orbing) is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill
                inside an orb, typically made of transparent plastic. Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope
                but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control. In the absence of hills, some
                operators have constructed inflatable, wooden, or metal ramps. Due to the buoyant nature of the orbs,
                Zorbing can also be carried out on water, provided the orb is inflated properly and sealed once the
                rider is inside. "Water walking" using such orbs has become popular in theme parks across the UK.
                There are two types of orbs: harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harnessed orbs carry up to three riders,
                while the harnessed orbs are constructed for one to two riders. The first zorbing site was established
                in Rotorua, New Zealand,
                by ZORB Ltd.

            <p>Pretty much rolling down a hill inside a special transparent orb, that is generally made out of
                plastic. These giant inflatable balls are called Zorbs and are of different types. Some have harnesses
                and
                straps to hold the rider in position. Others allow the rider to walk freely inside, or to be tossed
                around
                by the ball motion. Sometimes people would pour water inside, and the rider just slides around freely
                while the inflatable ball rolls downhill. This is called hydrozorbing (check the picture below). All
                orbs
                can be used to float on water, but some are specifically designed for that and are called Water Balls
                (these). And last but not least, there is the less known little sister of the Zorb, the Bubble Ball.
                Don’t let their smaller size fool you, because what you can actually do inside a bubble ball will
                surprise you! You can see for yourself here. The bubble balls are meant for many different
                activities and sports (such as zorb Football) or simply free-running.</p>

            <p>There is no denying this is an increasingly popular sport. Rolling down on a hill while strapped
                inside a giant inflatable ball, you can reach speeds of more than 30 miles per hour. The current record
                holder has topped his downhill speed at 32 miles per hour (52 km per hour). Now that is pure adrenaline!
                It’s like going on a roller coaster ride, but a little more insane. So, for extreme sports enthusiasts
                or
                people who simply enjoy the thrill, zorbing is definitely the thing to try out. As long as it is
                done in a controlled environment, or a specially designed location, it is safe and super fun! Check out
                how
                funit is in the video below. And don’t forget to see what it’s like to spend a day inside a bubble ball
                here! Let the good times roll!</p>

            <p>In 1994, two men from New Zeeland (Andrew Akers and Dwane van der Sluis) revitalized the concept. They
                came up with the idea of building transparent plastic, inflatable spheres that people could fit in. They
                used a franchise system to commercialize their invention and the trend caught on fast. The media
                presented
                the whole concept as a novelty, and the it caught on fast. However, proper credit has to be given to the
                initial
                creator of these giant plastic balls, a french guy called Gilles Ebersolt. He patented his invention way
                earlier
                than them, back in the 1970s.</p>

            <p>The activity is also referred to as Orbing or Sphereing. The word Zorbing now officially exists in the
                English
                language after it entered the Concise Oxford English Dictionary in 2001, and in some cases people even
                consider
                it an extreme sport.

                The sport has gained a lot of popularity in the media lately, and a lot of celebrities have tried it
                out.
                Jason Statham, Jimmy Fallon, Collin Farell, Chris Prat have all had a go. The sport even gained the
                attention
                of giant car manufacturer companies. Nissan went full nuts when they set a real life car inside one of
                these
                giant inflatable balls and rolled it down a hill as a publicity stunt</p>
